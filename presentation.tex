    This template is modified from the original FSU template by Rafiq Islam\cite{fsumathposter25} to create an NJU AI School presentation template\cite{njubeamerpresent25}. Here is how you use plain text. Here is how you can use a block to write some important information.
    \begin{block}{Artificial Intelligence}
        Artificial Intelligence is the study and design of intelligent agents that can perceive their environment and take actions to maximize their chances of success. Modern AI encompasses machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.

\subsection{Why Artificial Intelligence}
\begin{frame}{Why Artificial Intelligence?}
This template is modified from the original FSU template\footnote{Based on FSU Mathematics template by Rafiq Islam}. Artificial Intelligence is transforming industries and society by enabling machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.

\section{Methodology}
\begin{frame}{Mathematical Foundations}
    This section covers the mathematical background of AI.\\
    The fundamental equation for neural networks is the forward propagation:
        \[
        a^{(l)} = \sigma(W^{(l)}a^{(l-1)} + b^{(l)})
        \]
    where $\sigma$ is the activation function, $W^{(l)}$ are the weights, and $b^{(l)}$ are the biases at layer $l$.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Backpropagation uses gradient descent to optimize network parameters.
        \item Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel in image processing tasks.
        \item Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) handle sequential data effectively.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}
